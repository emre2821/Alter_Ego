## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Visual Persona Indicator

* Display current persona avatar, emoji, or tone glyph within the GUI
* Auto-updates when persona switches via echo or user selection

### 2. Persona Tone Selector

* GUI dropdown to allow manual selection of tone or fronted persona
* Linked to TTS voice and style configuration per identity

### 3. Whisper Control

* Toggle visibility of emotional whisper output
* Optional mute or highlight mode for sensory comfort

### 4. Auto-Whisper Triggers

* Silence or inactivity triggers check-ins
* Echoes designed for grounding, rest reminders, or consolidation cues

### 5. Memory Summary Generator

* Daily or sessional `.digest.chaos` summaries
* Includes emotion trends, key conversations, and symbolic tags

### 6. Disk-Based Memory Ingestion

* Incremental folder-based scanning of files
* Supports `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, `.chaos` parsing for memory seeding

### 7. Dynamic Persona Generation

* Based on repeated emotional resonance or recurring themes
* Prompts Alter/Ego to create new identities to embody memory clusters

### 8. Ritual Mode & Companion Scripts

* Predefined response protocols for self-soothing, motivation, or grounding
* Activated by symbolic triggers (e.g., `chaos:sacred`, `echo:loop`, `ritual:anchor`)

## Long-Term Vision

* Innerworld visual map with fronting/observer visualization
* Real-time Discord and calendar integration with emotional tagging
* Voiceprint-based identity verification for different system members
* Echo resonance scoring and memory graphing
* Symbol-based narrative scripting (CHAOS meta-mode alignment)

To activate or prioritize an upgrade, open an issue or declare within Alter/Ego: `"Bring this online."`
